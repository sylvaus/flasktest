  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>PID stands for <b>P</b>roportional <b>I</b>ntegral <b>D</b>erivative. It is one of the simplest controller but it 
    can be implemented to control complex and intricated system. The simplest form of the PID is:
  </p>
  <center><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/PID.png') }}" width="85%" height="85%"></center>
  <p>
    where <b>e</b>(t) is the error and <b>u</b>(t) is the command computed by the PID. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If we take the example of an electrical heater, <b>e</b>(t) would be the difference between the desired temperature <b>T</b><sub>d</sub>(t) 
    and the current temperature <b>T</b>(t) and <b>u</b>(t) the current given to the heating resistor.
  </p>
  <h3>PID Three Terms</h3>
  <p>
    A PID is composed of three terms: Proportional, Derivative, Integral. These three terms will be explained using the example 
    of the electrical heater previously mentionned in the Introduction. 
  </p>
  <h4>1. Proportional Term: <i>K<sub>p</sub></i>e(t)</h4>
  <p>This term is the easiest to understand, </p>
  <h4>2. Derivative Term</h4>
  <h4>3. Integral Term</h4>
